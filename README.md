### Market Analysis for AutoSparePart

The auto spare parts industry is a newly emerging market with a growing consumer base. While traditional methods of purchasing spare parts (such as visiting physical stores or contacting suppliers directly) are still prevalent, there is an increasing trend towards online purchasing platforms. This shift towards online shopping presents a significant opportunity for AutoSparePart to establish itself as a leading player in the market.

**Competition:** AutoSparePart will face competition from other online spare parts retailers as well as traditional brick-and-mortar stores. However, we believe that our user-friendly platform and extensive range of products will differentiate us from competitors and make us a preferred choice for customers.

**Target Market:** Our primary focus will be on vehicle owners of all types and demographics. We will also target auto repair shops and dealerships as potential customers for our products, as these organizations are constantly seeking reliable sources for spare parts.

### Marketing and Sales Strategy for AutoSparePart

AutoSparePart will utilize a combination of online and offline marketing tactics to reach our target market. These tactics will include:

Online Advertising: Utilizing Google AdWords and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram to reach potential customers.

### Operations and Management for AutoSparePart

AutoSparePart will be operated and managed by a small team of experienced professionals. The team will consist of a CEO, CTO, and marketing and sales staff.

Operations:

### Financial Plan for AutoSparePart

Revenue Generation: AutoSparePart will generate revenue through the sale of auto spare parts in our ecommerce shop and through partnerships with auto repair shops and dealerships.

Expenses: The main costs will be marketing and advertising efforts to drive traffic to the website and attract customers. We will also incur expenses related to inventory procurement and storage, as well as operational costs such as shipping and handling.

Financing: AutoSparePart will initially be funded through a combination of personal investment and a small seed round of funding. As the business grows, we will explore additional funding options such as venture capital or a larger round of financing.

Projections: We anticipate strong growth in revenue over the first few years of operation. In the first year, we expect to generate €500,000 in revenue, with €300,000 coming from product sales and €200,000 from partnerships. In the second year, we expect revenue to increase to €750,000, with €450,000 from product sales and €300,000 from partnerships. By the third year, we anticipate revenue to reach €1 million, with €600,000 from product sales and €400,000 from partnerships.

## AWS 

I am using AWS S3 buckets to store my data. S3 is a highly scalable and durable cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services. It allows me to easily store and retrieve large amounts of data, and its built-in security features provide added protection for my files. I chose S3 for its scalability, durability, and security features.

## Database

Database for an auto spare parts e-commerce website involves several key considerations to ensure it meets the needs of both the business and its customers. Here are some important aspects:

##### Key Considerations
1. Product Information Management:
   * Comprehensive Product Data: Ensure that each auto part has detailed information, including part number, description, compatibility, images, and specifications.
2. Database Structure:
   * Relational Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL to manage complex relationships between products, categories, and vehicle models.
   * Scalability: Design the database to handle a large volume of products and transactions, allowing for future growth2.
3. Search and Filtering:
   * Advanced Search: Provide robust search functionality that allows users to search by part number, vehicle model, or keywords.
   * Filtering Options: Include filters for brand, price, compatibility, and other relevant criteria to help users narrow down their choices3.
4. User Accounts and Order Management:
   * User Profiles: Allow users to create accounts to save their vehicle information, track orders, and manage wishlists.
   * Order History: Maintain a record of past orders for easy reordering and customer service2.
5. Security:
   * Data Protection: Implement strong security measures to protect user data, including encryption and secure payment processing.
6. User-Friendly Interface: Ensure the database supports a user-friendly front-end interface for easy navigation and product discovery.
   * Mobile Compatibility: Optimize the database and website for mobile users, as many customers will shop from their smartphones2.

**The reason why the warnings here wasn't fixed was because i tried to refactor the codes in different ways, but find out that it was causing bugs and throwing red lines in my gitpod workspace, so didn't really know how to fix that yet and because of time i just decided to live it future works**

<details>
<summary>View browser responsive testing images</summary>

**I've decided to add to add these screenshoots images here below for real browser responsiveness, because i found out that after i used Am I Responsive website to check my website if responsive, but on tablet it seems like the icons for wishlist, profile and cart are under the nav which i can't really see the same when i tested it responsiveness manually from the browser and the result carried out here from these images showed that the website is responsive**

## Bugs

**Issues found:** 
- When i first deployed the website to heroku, i found that the website wasn't opening all i saw was just Server Error 505
- When i first deployed the website to heroku, i found that alot of images were broken and only the Alt name was only showing up
- Found that the page 404 added to the website when a user tries to enter an invalid url link wasn't hidden under the navigation bar
- On tablet screen size the remove product button under the increment button in the cart is not really aligning properly

**Issues Fixed:**
- When a user log in to the deployed website from heroku site no longer displaying Server error 505 ✔️
- Go to all products page now all broken and lost images are displaying properly as expected ✔️
- When a user enter a wrong url error 404 page now displaying properly no longer under the navigation bar ✔️ 

#### Unfixed bugs
- The remove product button under the increment button in the cart is not really aligning properly on tablet screen, only on tablet, i've tried and spent many hours trying to fix the error, but in anyhow i try fixing the error it keeps affecting other screen sizes so just because of time i just decided to leave it for a future fix

- In the shopping cart there are two **Back to store** links display on same row and column on screen size between tablet and a little bit larger whcih is something i didn't really wanted it to be that way. I personally added those two links which one have to be on top on smaller screen why on larger screen the both links have to display on top while the other on the bottom. I've tried using bootstrap to stop them both from displaying on same row and column on smaller screen which one have to be hidden but not on the bottom on larger screen but its wasn't working so just because of time i leave that error for a future fix.

And also a big thanks to one of my biggest google search engine [Copilot or Ai-bing](https://www.bing.com/chat?form=NTPCHB) it was one of the tools i used in every of my project, especially when i get a terminal error that i don't completely undertsand i just copy and paste the errors to this search engine and it help me figure out what wrong and how to fix it.
